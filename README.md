For GTK, I use the WhiteSur-light theme with Big Sur icons. You can find them elsewhere(i can't be bothered to put links here tbh).

## installing

Make sure you have the proper fonts, icons, apps, and themes installed before copying my dotfiles. The fonts I use are SF Pro Display and JetBrains Mono.

Config files sometimes point to locations on disk. Make sure you correct the paths before using these dotfiles, otherwise they may not work.

Also make sure you install the scripts.
