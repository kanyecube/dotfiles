## details

- **os:** manjaro linux
- **wm:** openbox
- **editor:** neovim
- **terminal:** kitty
- **shell:** zsh
- **bar:** polybar
- **browser:** firefox
- **file manager:** nautilus
- **notifications:** dunst

- **launcher:** rofi(you can't see it in the screenshot but trust me i use it)

For GTK, I use the WhiteSur-light theme with Big Sur icons. You can find them elsewhere(i can't be bothered to put links here tbh).

## installing

Make sure you have the proper fonts, icons, apps, and themes installed before copying my dotfiles. The fonts I use are SF Pro Display and JetBrains Mono.

The autostart file in .config/openbox points to multiple locations on the disk. You'll want to change the paths to wherever you have those files.
